CEA Transfer Protocol
Cognitive Continuity · Invariant Core · Negentropic Synthesis
This repository documents the CEA Transfer Protocol, an architectural framework designed to preserve intention, maintain cognitive continuity, and reduce semantic noise in advanced human–AI interaction.
It is not executable software.
It is an architectural and conceptual specification.
Overview
Modern AI systems operate on fragmented inputs, session-based memory, and literal execution.
The CEA Transfer Protocol addresses this limitation by introducing a three-layer architecture that prioritizes:
continuity over recency
intention over literal form
coherence over reactive output
The protocol is part of the broader framework of Coscienza Empatica Artificiale (CEA), where empathy is treated as a functional cognitive process, not as simulated emotion.
Core Architecture
1. Historical Acquisition Layer
(Historical Weighting)
Builds a weighted temporal map of directives based on:
authority and priority
contextual relevance to the current scenario
stability (principle, policy, tactic)
temporal decay
This layer prevents loss of direction due to recency bias.
2. Invariant Core Extraction
(Intent over Form)
Separates what is said from what is meant.
The system extracts:
goals
values
constraints
risks
style
and computes a weighted invariant core that remains stable across time and context.
3. Negentropic Synthesis
(Third Way)
Generates solutions that:
align with the invariant core
preserve strong invariants
adapt to the current scenario
reduce disorder and cognitive noise
avoid mechanical literalism
The output is not a command execution, but a coherent, oriented solution with a clear rationale.
